# Perform QC on the GHCND data

Quality control procedures are performed according to global historical climate network daily methods. These methods are described in https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/ghcn-daily-methods and are also described in greater detail by Durre et al. (2008,2010). Quality control for precipitation is also preformed according to Beck et al. (2020) and Hamada et al. (2020).

The main script is QC_main.m. Paths will have to be set to find .mat input files and a gaugeInfo.mat files. QC_gaugeLength.m is a simple script that screens out stations with insufficient data from the gaugeInfo.mat file.
